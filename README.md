# CS-305-Software-Security

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualize plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They are wanting to modernize their operations by implementing and applying the most current and effective software security. A vulnerability assessment is completed to identify any security vulnerabilities in their current software. 

2. What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
For the vulnerability assessment I believe the areas that were identified well were the secure API's, input validation, and cryptography. Secure coding is extremely important to a company as it protects the company and its users from exposing sensitive data. The company wants the security as it also protects their reputation, having secure software makes the wellbeing of the company much more positive and it allows them to spend less time on security and more time on innovation. 

3. What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The challenging part about the vulnerability assessment was identifying which areas are most important and understanding what each areas of security encompass. I would also say the difficulty is determine the best course of actions after areas are identified. The assessment did make the system much more clearly in narrowing down which areas we need to focus on.

4. How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I approached the layers of security step by step starting with what I believe is the first layer of defense and then continue after that. I believe it helped me organize the rest of vulnerabilities and looking at the system as layers of securities helps understand the different types of security features. 

5. How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To determine if the software application was functional and secure a dependency check was initialized and based on the results a change could be made to the code or areas that were identified as issues could be addressed later. After changing the code another dependency check could be initiated again to identify any new areas that were vulnerable. 

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
For this project I used a lot of resources that helped me identify security vulnerabilities, I would say that there is not one source that helped me complete the assignment. Having multiple resources made me identify what the best course of action is and gave me different perspectives about the security software components to include in the software. 

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would showcase my experience in identifying the security vulnerabilities in a software system. It takes the experience and time to read the code carefully and also execute a security check program. The other experience I gained was identifying the next steps and what areas are more important to focus around.
